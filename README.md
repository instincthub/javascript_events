# Introduction to Javascript
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or [just-in-time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) compiled programming language with [first-class functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/First-class_Function).

While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, [many non-browser environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript#Other_usage) also use it, such as [Node.js](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Node.js), [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) and [Adobe Acrobat](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/acrobatsdk/).

JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more [about JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/About_JavaScript).

*This tutorial is dedicated to reveal JavaScript functionality and how you can start applying it to your project.*

## Prerequisites
Before starting this tutorial, you don't need any previous JavaScript knowledge, but you should have some familiarity with [HTML](https://skills.instincthub.com/course/html-fundamentals/) and [CSS](https://skills.instincthub.com/course/introduction-css-basics/). You are advised to know these two components of the web before starting on JavaScript:

## Activity 2
currently, the handlers are inside of the p tags, using what you've learnt, set the event handlers inside the Javascript file instead.

###Instriction:
1. Download the project and work on the `[event_listener](https://github.com/instincthub/javascript_events)` directory.
2. In the directory, you are to work on: `[refactoring_onclick.html](https://github.com/instincthub/javascript_events/blob/main/event_listener/refactoring_onclick.html)` and `[assets/script.js](https://github.com/instincthub/javascript_events/blob/main/event_listener/assets/script.js)`.
3. Remove all all `even` on the `p` tags
4. Add unique `IDs` to the `p` tags.
5. Target the `IDs` in the `script.js` file and add `addEventListener`.
